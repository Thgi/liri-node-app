# liri-node-app

The LIRI Node app is designed to be a SIRI-like application which performs tasks based on what the user's request.

LIRI stands for Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI is designed to do each of the 4 commands:

spotify-this-song will cause LIRI to find information using Spotify on the song name the user provides

my-tweets will make LIRI search the user's Twitter page for the last tweets the user sent out.

movie-this will make LIRI search for information regarding the movie name the user provides by searching through the OMDB API.

do-what-it-says will open the random.txt file which should have a list of the command 

liri-node-app is the first use of using Node.js to run the Javascript logic.

This is also the first use of npm. npm is the package manager for JavaScript and the world's largest software registry.

I utilize npm in order to access Twitter, OMDB, and Spotify. Each npm package is like its own API where you include it as part
of your package in order to access each site's resources.
